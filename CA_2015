Gov procurement comes out of purview of WTO rules

A joint session of the Indian Parliament, convened under Article 108 of the Constitution, is a rare mechanism to resolve deadlocks
between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on legislative bills (excluding Money Bills and Constitution Amendment Bills). The bill is passed 
by a simple majority in the joint sitting. As of June 7, 2025, only three laws have been passed through joint sessions of the Indian 
Parliament since independence. Below are the details of these laws:
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961:
Joint Session: May 6 and 9, 1961.

Context: The Lok Sabha passed the Dowry Prohibition Bill, but the Rajya Sabha proposed amendments that led to a disagreement. 
The bill aimed to curb the dowry system, which had become a significant social issue. After discussions and assurances from the
Law Minister, a joint sitting was called—the first in India’s parliamentary history.

Outcome: The bill was passed with amendments and received presidential assent on May 20, 1961, becoming the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 
(Act 28 of 1961).

Banking Service Commission (Repeal) Act, 1978:
Joint Session: May 16, 1978.

Context: The Lok Sabha passed the Banking Service Commission (Repeal) Bill, 1977, but it was rejected by the Rajya Sabha on December 8, 1977.
The bill aimed to repeal the Banking Service Commission Act. The President summoned a joint sitting to resolve the deadlock.

Outcome: The bill was passed with amendments during the joint session and became law.

Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), 2002:
Joint Session: March 26, 2002.

Context: The Lok Sabha passed the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, 2002, to address national security concerns, but it faced opposition in the 
Rajya Sabha, leading to a deadlock. The President called a joint sitting, the third in India’s history.

Outcome: The bill was passed and became the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002.

Key Notes
Rarity of Joint Sessions: Joint sessions are rare because they are a last resort when other methods (e.g., negotiations or committees) fail 
to resolve disagreements between the two Houses. Only three instances have occurred in over seven decades since independence.

Exclusions: Money Bills (requiring only Lok Sabha approval) and Constitution Amendment Bills (requiring a two-thirds majority in each 
House separately) cannot be referred to a joint sitting.

Procedure: The President summons the joint sitting, presided over by the Lok Sabha Speaker (or Deputy Speaker, Deputy Chairman of
Rajya Sabha, or another MP by consensus if none are available). The Central Hall of Parliament (now Samvidhan Sadan or the new Sansad Bhavan 
for larger sessions) is used.

Quorum: The quorum for a joint sitting is one-tenth of the total members of both Houses (approximately 80 members, based on 543 Lok Sabha 
and 245 Rajya Sabha members).

Recent Context: No joint sessions have been reported for passing laws after 2002 up to June 2025, based on available information. Recent 
legislative activity (e.g., 2023–2024 sessions) focused on bills like the Public Examinations Act, 2024, and others, but none required a 
joint sitting.

Conclusion
As of June 7, 2025, the Indian Parliament has passed three laws through joint sessions: the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961; the Banking Service 
Commission (Repeal) Act, 1978; and the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. These instances reflect the exceptional nature of joint sittings, 
invoked only when significant legislative deadlocks arise.

Viability Gap Funding (VGF) is a financial support mechanism provided by the government to make economically desirable but financially 
unviable infrastructure projects commercially feasible. In the context of India’s National Solar Mission and solar parks, VGF is a 
critical tool to bridge the funding gap for solar power projects, particularly those with high upfront costs or low revenue potential. 
Below is a detailed explanation of VGF, its purpose, application in solar parks, and key features.
What is Viability Gap Funding?
Definition: VGF is a one-time or deferred grant provided by the government to infrastructure projects to enhance their financial viability, 
typically when the project is not profitable enough to attract private investment without support.

Purpose: To reduce the financial burden on private developers, lower project costs, and make tariffs competitive, thereby encouraging 
private sector participation in public-private partnership (PPP) projects.

Sectors: Commonly used for infrastructure projects like highways, airports, railways, and renewable energy projects, including solar parks 
and ultra-mega solar power projects.

VGF in the Context of Solar Parks
Role in Solar Energy: VGF supports large-scale solar projects, such as those in solar parks, by covering a portion of the capital costs,
making them attractive to private developers despite low initial returns or high infrastructure expenses.

Administering Authority: In India, VGF for solar projects is managed by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and implemented
through agencies like the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).

Objective: To achieve India’s solar capacity targets (e.g., 100 GW by 2022, 280 GW by 2030) by reducing the cost of solar power generation
and ensuring affordable tariffs for consumers.

Key Features of VGF for Solar Projects
Funding Structure:
VGF is provided as a capital subsidy, typically up to 30% of the total project cost or a fixed amount per MW, depending on the scheme.

For solar parks, VGF is often disbursed to cover infrastructure costs (e.g., transmission lines, substations) or to reduce the cost of 
power generation.

Example: Under the Solar Park Scheme, VGF can be up to ₹20 lakh per MW or 30% of the project cost for developing park infrastructure.

Competitive Bidding:
Developers bid for projects, quoting the lowest tariff or VGF requirement. The bidder requiring the least VGF or offering the lowest 
tariff is awarded the project.

This ensures cost-effectiveness and transparency in fund allocation.

Disbursement:
Funds are released in phases, linked to project milestones (e.g., land acquisition, equipment installation, commissioning).

SECI or state agencies monitor progress to ensure compliance.

Eligibility:
Projects must align with national priorities, such as renewable energy targets.

Typically applies to utility-scale solar projects, including those under the Solar Park Scheme or the Central Public Sector Undertaking
(CPSU) Scheme Phase-II.

VGF Schemes for Solar Projects
Solar Park Scheme (2014):
Supports the development of 50 solar parks with a cumulative capacity of 40 GW.

VGF covers infrastructure costs like land preparation, transmission systems, and roads.

Financial Assistance: Up to ₹25 lakh per park for Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) and ₹20 lakh per MW for infrastructure.

Example: Bhadla Solar Park (2,245 MW) benefited from VGF to reduce developer costs, enabling tariffs as low as ₹2.44/kWh.

CPSU Scheme Phase-II (2019):
Targets 12 GW of solar PV projects by government producers (e.g., NTPC, NHPC).

Provides ₹85.8 billion in VGF to make projects financially viable.

VGF is capped at ₹70 lakh per MW or 70% of the project cost, whichever is lower.

Ultra-Mega Solar Power Projects:
Large projects (500 MW or more) within solar parks receive VGF to offset high capital costs.

Example: Pavagada Solar Park (2,050 MW) used VGF to support infrastructure and attract developers.


Benefits of VGF in Solar Parks
Lower Tariffs: By reducing capital costs, VGF enables developers to offer competitive electricity tariffs, benefiting consumers and 
utilities.

Private Investment: Attracts private and foreign investors by mitigating financial risks, contributing to US$3.76 billion in solar 
investments in FY2023–24.

Faster Deployment: Reduces financial barriers, accelerating project timelines and supporting India’s 107.94 GW solar capacity as of 
April 2025.

Scalability: Enables large-scale projects like Bhadla and Pavagada, critical for meeting the 280 GW solar target by 2030.

Energy Access: Supports grid-connected solar power, enhancing energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Challenges of VGF
Limited Funding:
Budget constraints limit the number of projects that can receive VGF, slowing progress toward targets (e.g., only 10.4 GW of 
solar park capacity commissioned by November 2023).

Implementation Delays:
Bureaucratic processes and delays in fund disbursement can hinder project timelines.

Example: Some solar parks faced delays due to slow VGF allocation or infrastructure bottlenecks.

Dependency Risk:
Over-reliance on VGF may discourage developers from innovating cost-effective solutions or investing in unsubsidized projects.

Monitoring and Accountability:
Ensuring funds are used efficiently and projects meet milestones requires robust oversight, which can be challenging for 
large-scale schemes.

Example of VGF Impact
Bhadla Solar Park, Rajasthan:
VGF supported infrastructure development, reducing the financial burden on developers.

Resulted in one of the world’s lowest solar tariffs (₹2.44/kWh in 2017 auctions), making solar power competitive with 
coal-based electricity.

Contributed to Rajasthan’s leadership in India’s solar capacity.

Conclusion
Viability Gap Funding is a pivotal instrument in India’s solar energy strategy, enabling the development of large-scale 
solar parks and utility-scale projects by bridging financial gaps. By providing capital subsidies, VGF lowers tariffs, 
attracts investment, and accelerates solar capacity addition, contributing to India’s 107.94 GW solar capacity as of April 2025. 
However, challenges like limited funding and implementation delays need addressing to maximize its impact toward the 280 GW solar
target by 2030. VGF remains essential for scaling renewable energy infrastructure while ensuring affordability and sustainability.


Article 123 of the Constitution allows the government to recommend the President to pass an ordinance if Parliament is in recess 
and to meet emergent needs.
Article 123 (2) provides that an ordinance must be replaced by a law not later than six weeks from the re-assembly of the two Houses.
SUPREME COURT RULING LIMITS LIFE OF ORDINANCES
• In 1986, the Supreme Court judgment in D.C. Wadhwa versus State of Bihar declared that it was the “constitutional duty” of the public 
to approach the court against re-promulgation of ordinances in a massive scale as a routine measure.
• The apex court held “the power to promulgate an ordinance is essentially a power to be used to meet an extraordinary situation and 
cannot be allowed to be ‘perverted to serve political ends’.
• There must not be an Ordinance Raj in the country,” a five-judge Bench led by the then Chief Justice of India, P.N. Bhagwati, observed 
in the judgment of December 20,1986.
• An ordinance is promulgated by the President on the Union Cabinet’s advice under Article 123 of the Constitution. It is a power wielded 
in circumstances that require immediate action. Ordinances cannot be re-promulgated on a massive scale in a routine manner, the apex court
had held.
• Way Forward: Due to continuous disruption of parliament proceedings, the government was not in position to pass many important legislation
that require urgent legislative amendment to promote growth and favorable investment environment in the country. Hence it took the route of 
ordinance and the government is well within constitutional limits to issue ordinances. Moreover ordinances are short term measures that 
needs to be taken in the next setting of parliament.
